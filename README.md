# bubble-sort
This repository contains a simple implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in C++. Bubble Sort is a basic sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the array, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process continues until the array is fully sorted in ascending order.
